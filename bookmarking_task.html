<p><b>Nikola Tesla</b> was a Serbian-American engineer, futurist, and inventor. He is known for his contributions to the design of the modern alternating current (AC) electricity supply system.

Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla first studied engineering and physics in the 1870s without receiving a degree. He then gained practical experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental Edison in the new electric power industry. In 1884 he immigrated to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen. He worked for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His AC induction motor and related polyphase AC patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the polyphase system which that company eventually marketed.</p>

<p><b>Alternating Current Power Systems (1887):</b> <br>
    One of Tesla’s most significant inventions was the development of the Alternating Current (AC) power system. Before Tesla, the existing Direct Current (DC) system, supported by Thomas Edison, had very limited use in power distribution. Tesla did not invent alternating current – that work began with Michael Faraday’s early experiments in the 1830s – but Tesla revolutionized its application with the rotating magnetic field. This led to the development of a practical system of AC power, including the AC induction motor (1887) and the polyphase AC system (1888), inventions which made it possible to efficiently transmit power over long distances and thus power entire cities. Tesla’s AC technology is still the standard for power generation and distribution worldwide, enabling the electrification of homes, industries, and cities around the world. </p>
<p><b>The Tesla Coil (1891):</b> <br> 
    The Tesla Coil, a high-voltage transformer circuit capable of producing high-frequency alternating current (AC), was foundational for many of Tesla’s wireless power experiments and is still used today in radio technology, neon lighting, and education.  </p>
<p><b>Tesla Turbine (1909):</b><br> 
    The Tesla Turbine, also known as the bladeless turbine, used a series of smooth, parallel disks to harness fluid dynamics for mechanical power. While it did not gain widespread use in Tesla’s time, it remains a subject of interest for its innovative design and potential applications. </p>
